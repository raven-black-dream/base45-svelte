## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need to enhance analytics capabilities using existing UserExerciseMetrics and UserMuscleGroupMetrics tables, focusing on pattern recognition and performance analysis rather than prescriptive recommendations.

## Decision
Implement an analytics enhancement strategy focused on:

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Analyze performance trends
   - Track adaptation rates
   - Identify training patterns
   - Use statistical analysis for insights

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Use Plotly.js for interactive visualizations
   - Implement pattern visualization tools
   - Create comprehensive dashboards
   - Focus on trend analysis

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Implement trend prediction
   - Calculate confidence scores
   - Generate pattern-based insights
   - Avoid prescriptive recommendations

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better understanding of training patterns
- Data-driven insights
- Enhanced user experience through visualization
- Non-prescriptive approach maintains existing progression logic

### Negative
- Complex pattern recognition implementation
- Computational overhead for analytics
- Need for careful data interpretation
- Initial implementation complexity

## Technical Approach
1. Use existing metrics tables as foundation
2. Add new models for predictions and insights
3. Implement statistical analysis tools
4. Create visualization components

## Success Metrics
- Pattern recognition accuracy
- User engagement with insights
- Dashboard performance
- User satisfaction

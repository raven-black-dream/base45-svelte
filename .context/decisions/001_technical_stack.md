Date: 2025-01-20
Status: Accepted
---

## Context
The project requires a modern, performant web application framework with strong typing support, efficient state management, and reliable authentication/database solutions.

## Decision
We have chosen the following core technologies:

1. Frontend Framework: SvelteKit
   - Reasons:
     - Excellent performance with minimal bundle size
     - Strong TypeScript support
     - Built-in routing and SSR capabilities
     - Growing ecosystem and community

2. Database & Authentication: Prisma + Supabase
   - Reasons:
     - Type-safe database queries with Prisma
     - Reliable authentication system with Supabase
     - Real-time capabilities
     - Managed database service reducing operational overhead

3. UI Components: Skeleton + TailwindCSS
   - Reasons:
     - Consistent design system
     - Highly customizable
     - Good performance with PurgeCSS
     - Responsive by default

4. Monitoring & Analytics: Sentry
   - Reasons:
     - Comprehensive error tracking
     - Performance monitoring
     - Good SvelteKit integration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved development velocity with type safety
- Better performance with Svelte's compilation
- Reduced operational complexity with managed services
- Strong developer experience with modern tooling

### Negative
- Learning curve for developers new to Svelte
- Dependency on third-party services
- Need to manage multiple service providers

### Risks
- Potential cost scaling with Supabase usage
- Need to maintain compatibility with service updates
- Community support may vary for some tools

## Svelte 5 Features and Implementation

### Decision
We will utilize Svelte 5's new features, particularly the runes system, for better state management and reactivity in our application.

### Context
Svelte 5 introduces several new concepts and improvements:
- Runes: New syntax for reactive state management with `$` prefix (e.g., `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`)
- `.svelte.js`/`.svelte.ts` support: Ability to use runes in regular JavaScript/TypeScript files
- Improved component architecture with cleaner syntax
- Better TypeScript integration

### Consequences
#### Positive
- More intuitive state management with runes
- Ability to share reactive logic across components using `.svelte.js` files
- Better code organization possibilities
- Future-proof implementation using latest Svelte features

#### Negative
- Learning curve for new runes syntax
- Limited community resources due to Svelte 5's recency
- Potential need to refactor code as Svelte 5 evolves

### Implementation Notes
- Use `$state` for component-level state management
- Leverage `.svelte.js` files for shared reactive logic
- Follow Svelte 5's new best practices for component structure

## Alternatives Considered
- Next.js + React
- NestJS + Angular
- FastAPI + Vue

## Updates
- 2025-01: Upgraded to SvelteKit 2.5 and Prisma 6.0
- 2024-12: Added Skeleton UI components

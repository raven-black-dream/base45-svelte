## Date
2025-01-21

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need to implement a secure and scalable trainer-client relationship management system that enables trainers to oversee their clients' progress while maintaining data privacy.

## Decision
Implement a dedicated trainer-client relationship system with the following architecture:

1. **Database Schema**
   - Create TrainerProfile model for trainer-specific data
   - Implement ClientTrainerRelationship model for relationship management
   - Extend User model to support trainer/client roles

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement strict access control at the database level
   - Use relationship status for access management
   - Audit logging for sensitive operations

3. **API Structure**
   - Separate trainer and client endpoints
   - Implement relationship-based data access
   - Use SvelteKit's server-side routing

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of trainer and client concerns
- Strong data privacy controls
- Scalable relationship management
- Flexible trainer-client interactions

### Negative
- Additional complexity in access control
- Need for careful relationship state management
- Increased database complexity

## Implementation Plan
1. Core infrastructure and database schema
2. Trainer features and dashboard
3. Client features and interactions
4. Advanced features and optimizations

## Success Metrics
- Trainer adoption rate
- Client satisfaction
- System performance
- Data privacy compliance

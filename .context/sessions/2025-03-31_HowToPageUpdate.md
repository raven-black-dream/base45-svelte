# Session Summary: How-To Page Updates

**Date:** 2025-03-31
**Participants:** USER, Cascade

## Goal

To update and improve the user-facing documentation located at `src/routes/how-to/+page.svelte`, reflecting recent feature additions and enhancing readability, particularly on mobile devices.

## Summary of Activities & Outcomes

1.  **Syntax Error Correction:**
    *   Identified and fixed syntax errors caused by unescaped curly braces (`{}`) in example text within the "Post-Workout Feedback" section.
    *   Escaped the braces using HTML entities (`&lbrace;` and `&rbrace;`) in `src/routes/how-to/+page.svelte`.

2.  **Feature Documentation:**
    *   Reviewed the implementation of the "Create Program Template" feature (`src/routes/programs/create/+page.svelte`).
    *   Added a new section to `how-to/+page.svelte` detailing the steps for creating custom program templates.
    *   Reviewed the implementation of the "Create Exercise" feature (`src/routes/exercises/create/+page.svelte`).
    *   Added a new section to `how-to/+page.svelte` explaining how users can add their own custom exercises.
    *   Updated existing text to direct users to these new features instead of requesting them from developers.

3.  **Content Formatting:**
    *   Reformatted the "Post-Workout Feedback" section description, changing a paragraph into a structured bulleted list to clearly explain *when* each type of feedback question is presented to the user.

4.  **Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   Applied responsive design improvements to the entire `src/routes/how-to/+page.svelte` page.
    *   Utilized Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g., `md:` prefixes, adjusted `p-`, `m-`, `space-y-`) to refine padding, margins, and spacing for better layout and readability on smaller screens.
    *   Wrapped the page content in a `max-w-4xl mx-auto` container for consistent presentation across screen sizes.

## Action Items

*   None for this specific session.

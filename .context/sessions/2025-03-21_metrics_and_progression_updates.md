# Session Summary 2025-03-21

## Context
- Previous session: [2025-02-26-ui-library-update.md](../sessions/2025-02-26-ui-library-update.md)
- Active phase: Development
- Current focus: Metrics system optimization (TASK-011) and workout progression consistency

## Changes Made
### Code Changes
- **Workout Progression System**
  - Fixed inconsistent set ordering in workout progression functions
  - Added explicit sorting of sets by `set_num` in multiple functions
  - Ensured consistent behavior in modifying rep and set numbers

- **Metrics System**
  - Modified the metrics system to update existing metrics instead of creating new ones
  - Implemented upsert operations in both `calculateMuscleGroupMetrics` and `calculateExerciseMetrics`
  - Optimized database operations using batch processing

### Documentation Updates
- N/A

### Decisions Made
- **Set Ordering**
  - Decided to always sort sets by `set_num` before processing to ensure consistent ordering
  - Rationale: Predictable order is critical for workout progression logic to work correctly
  - Impact: Ensures users experience consistent progression behavior

- **Metrics Storage**
  - Decision to update existing metrics instead of creating new ones each time
  - Rationale: Reduces database bloat and improves performance
  - Alternatives considered: Adding timestamps instead of replacing metrics (rejected due to complexity)
  - Impact: Improved performance for workouts with many exercises

## Technical Details
### Implementation Notes
- **Workout Progression**
  - Implemented sort operations before processing sets: `sets.sort((a, b) => a.set_num - b.set_num)`
  - Enhanced several key functions: `modifyRepNumber`, `nonProgression`, `progression`, and `loadAndRepProgression`
  - Applied consistent ordering pattern across the codebase for better maintainability

- **Metrics System**
  - Utilized Prisma's upsert operations for efficient database interaction
  - Implemented check for existing metrics by exercise, workout, and metric_name
  - Used Promise.all for batch operations to improve performance
  - Added null checks for `existingMetrics` to prevent potential runtime errors
  - Enhanced test cases to accurately reflect the expected behavior of the update functionality

### Dependencies
- No new dependencies added

### Testing Approach
- Added unit tests to validate metrics system update behavior
- Tests cover both creation of new metrics and updating existing ones
- Added test cases for edge conditions (empty data handling)

## Next Steps
### Completed Task: Update Existing Metrics (TASK-011)
- [x] Modify `src/lib/server/metrics.ts` to check for existing metrics before creating new ones
- [x] Implement UPDATE operations for existing metrics instead of recreating them
- [x] Ensure data consistency during transitions between create and update operations
- [x] Optimize database queries to reduce redundancy
- [x] Added tests to verify update functionality
- [x] Fixed null handling in metrics management

### Next Planned Task
- [ ] Implement handling for once-per-week muscle group progression (TASK-018)

### Open Questions
- **Database Performance Considerations**
  - Current understanding: Upsert operations provide better performance than separate lookup and creation
  - Implemented approach: Batch processing with Promise.all for concurrent operations
  - Future consideration: Monitor database performance as workout history grows

### Planned Features
- Short-term (next session):
  - Begin implementation of once-per-week muscle group progression
  - Address remaining TypeScript errors in the codebase
- Medium-term (next few sessions):
  - Enhance user feedback mechanisms for workout performance
  - Further optimize database queries for large workout histories

## Notes
### Important Observations
- The set ordering issue was subtle but had significant impact on workout progression consistency
- Database performance is becoming increasingly important as user workout history grows

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of consistent ordering in data structures that impact business logic
- Benefits of updating existing records vs. creating new ones for time-series data
- Value of comprehensive unit tests for database interactions

### Things to Watch
- Performance metrics for large workout histories
- TypeScript errors that need to be addressed
- User feedback on workout progression consistency

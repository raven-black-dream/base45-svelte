# Session Summary: 2025-04-01

## Session Goal
Finalize the implementation of the Long-Term Analytics visualizations, ensuring data is correctly processed, sorted, and displayed using `LinePlot` components. Update project context documentation.

## Participants
- USER
- Cascade (AI Assistant)

## Key Activities & Decisions
1.  **Review Previous State:** Started by reviewing the checkpoint summary which indicated the long-term analytics implementation was mostly complete but might have lint errors.
2.  **Identify Missing Logic:** User pointed out that the previously mentioned data sorting logic in `src/routes/analytics/long-term/+page.server.ts` was actually missing.
3.  **Code Review:** Viewed the contents of `+page.server.ts` to confirm the missing sort and understand the surrounding code.
4.  **Implement Sorting:** Added the `workoutProgressData.sort((a, b) => a.date.getTime() - b.date.getTime());` line after the data processing loop to ensure chronological order for the plots.
5.  **Context Updates:**
    *   Updated `.context/current_state.md` to accurately reflect the completion of the long-term analytics visualization feature, noting the remaining TypeScript error as technical debt.
    *   Updated `.context/roadmap.md` to mark the relevant visualization goal as achieved for Q1 2025 and updated the timestamp.
6.  **Session Documentation:** Created this session summary document.

## Outcomes
- Long-term analytics data in `+page.server.ts` is now correctly sorted by date.
- Project status documents (`current_state.md`, `roadmap.md`) have been updated.
- This session summary document has been created.

## Action Items / Next Steps
- **Resolve TypeScript Error:** Address the `Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'Date'` error in `src/routes/analytics/long-term/+page.server.ts` related to `setCorrelationData`.

## Files Modified
- `src/routes/analytics/long-term/+page.server.ts` (Added sorting logic)
- `.context/current_state.md` (Updated project status)
- `.context/roadmap.md` (Updated roadmap status)
- `.context/sessions/2025-04-01_Session_Summary.md` (Created)

## Notes
- The primary goal of implementing the long-term analytics visualization is now complete, pending the resolution of the identified TypeScript error.

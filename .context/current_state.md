- Additional workout metrics and analytics
- Offline support for workout tracking
- UI/UX improvements

## Technical State

### Core Dependencies
- SvelteKit v2.5.27 (with Svelte 5.0)
- Prisma v6.0.0 for database management
- Supabase for authentication and data storage
- TailwindCSS v3.4.0 for styling
- Skeleton UI components (updated implementation)
- Sentry for error tracking
- Plotly.js for data visualization
- Math.js for calculations

### Environment
- Development: Vite-based development server
- Testing: Vitest for unit testing
- Production: Node.js adapter with PostgreSQL database

## Current Implementation Status

### Svelte 5 Integration
- Decision made to use Svelte 5's new features, particularly the runes system
- Documentation and references for Svelte 5 have been collected and stored
- Key features to implement:
  - State management using `$state` rune for reactive data
  - Shared reactive logic in `.svelte.js` files
  - Component architecture following Svelte 5 best practices

### Next Steps
1. Update existing components to use Svelte 5's runes system
2. Implement state management using `$state` for complex data structures
3. Create shared reactive logic files for common functionality
4. Document patterns and best practices for the team

### Challenges
- Learning curve for team members with new runes syntax
- Need to carefully manage state updates in complex data structures
- Limited community resources for Svelte 5 specific issues

## Recent Changes
- Metrics system optimization: update existing metrics instead of recreating (Today)
- Fixed workout progression for consistent set ordering (Today)
- UI library update and mobile-responsive component implementation (23 days ago)
- Bug fixes and improvements to core functionality (60 days ago)
- Integration of latest SvelteKit and Prisma versions
- Enhanced error handling and monitoring with Sentry
- UI improvements with Skeleton component library

## Current Focus
- Optimizing database queries and performance
- Enhancing workout tracking and metrics visualization
- Implementing advanced workout progression features
- Stabilizing core features and fixing reported issues

## Known Technical Debt
- Need for comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Documentation updates needed for new features
- Potential database schema optimizations

## Active Development

### Completed Features
- User authentication system using Supabase
- Exercise management system with CRUD operations
- Workout tracking and history
- Program templates and customization
- Account management and user profile features
- Workout summary and progress tracking
- Weight history tracking
- User Documentation (`/how-to` page)
- Mobile-first responsive design implementation for core components
- Metrics system optimization (update existing metrics instead of recreating)
- Exercise List enhancements:
  - Displays all exercises in an accordion
  - Conditionally shows an 'Analytics' link for exercises the user has performed
  - Conditionally highlights performed exercises
  - Displays a performance summary table within each accordion panel (for performed exercises) showing set count, max weight, latest set (weight x reps), and latest date per rep range
- Long-Term Analytics Visualization:
  - Integrated `LinePlot` component for various performance and subjective feedback metrics.
  - Reshaped server-side data into Plotly trace format.
  - Ensured data passed to plots is sorted chronologically.
  - Used Skeleton UI `Accordion` for organizing plots.

### In Progress
- Recent bug fixes and improvements to core functionality
- Performance optimizations
  - Database query optimization (Task 004)
  - Client-side performance improvements
- Analytics Enhancement Implementation (Task 008)
  - Pattern recognition and analysis
  - Performance trend visualization (Long-term analytics page mostly complete)
  - Predictive insights
- Trainer-Client Relationship Feature (Task 008)
  - Database schema design
  - Core infrastructure planning
- Weekly Muscle Group Progression Feature (Task 018)
  - Designing implementation approach
- Improving Mesocycle Completion/Transition Logic (Task 012)
  - Addressing errors when completing the final workouts of a mesocycle and planning transitions/deloads
- Fixing TypeScript errors in `+page.server.ts` files (e.g., Long-Term Analytics `setCorrelationData` type issue).

### Upcoming
- Enhanced data visualization using Plotly.js (Task 003) - *Partially completed with Long-Term Analytics*
- Additional workout metrics and analytics
- Offline support for workout tracking
- UI/UX improvements

## Technical State

### Core Dependencies
- SvelteKit v2.5.27 (with Svelte 5.0)
- Prisma v6.0.0 for database management
- Supabase for authentication and data storage
- TailwindCSS v3.4.0 for styling
- Skeleton UI components (updated implementation)
- Sentry for error tracking
- Plotly.js / svelte-plotly.js for data visualization
- Math.js for calculations

### Environment
- Development: Vite-based development server
- Testing: Vitest for unit testing
- Production: Node.js adapter with PostgreSQL database

## Current Implementation Status

### Svelte 5 Integration
- Decision made to use Svelte 5's new features, particularly the runes system
- Documentation and references for Svelte 5 have been collected and stored
- Key features to implement:
  - State management using `$state` rune for reactive data
  - Shared reactive logic in `.svelte.js` files
  - Component architecture following Svelte 5 best practices

### Next Steps
1. Update existing components to use Svelte 5's runes system
2. Implement state management using `$state` for complex data structures
3. Create shared reactive logic files for common functionality
4. Document patterns and best practices for the team
5. Resolve remaining TypeScript errors.

### Challenges
- Learning curve for team members with new runes syntax
- Need to carefully manage state updates in complex data structures
- Limited community resources for Svelte 5 specific issues

## Recent Changes
- Updated and improved user documentation (`/how-to` page) with new features and mobile responsiveness (Previous Session)
- Metrics system optimization: update existing metrics instead of recreating (Previous Session)
- Fixed workout progression for consistent set ordering (Previous Session)
- UI library update and mobile-responsive component implementation (Previous Session)
- Bug fixes and improvements to core functionality (Previous Session)
- Integration of latest SvelteKit and Prisma versions
- Enhanced error handling and monitoring with Sentry
- UI improvements with Skeleton component library
- Successfully integrated performance statistics into the main exercise list (Previous Session)
- Implemented Bar Plot for Stimulus vs Rep Range on analytics page (Previous Session)
- Refactored metrics calculation to update existing records instead of creating duplicates (Previous Session)
- Added conditional links from exercise list to analytics page (Previous Session)
- Implemented Long-Term Analytics visualizations (Current Session)
  - Fetched and processed relevant workout data.
  - Reshaped data for Plotly.
  - Sorted data chronologically.
  - Updated Svelte component to use new data format and `LinePlot`.

## Current Focus
- Optimizing database queries and performance
- Enhancing workout tracking and metrics visualization (Long-Term Analytics complete)
- Implementing advanced workout progression features
- Stabilizing core features and fixing reported issues (TypeScript errors)
- Improving Mesocycle Completion/Transition Logic (Task 012)

## Known Technical Debt
- Need for comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Documentation updates needed for new features
- Potential database schema optimizations
- TypeScript errors in `src/routes/workout/[slug]/+page.server.ts` related to potential null values and type mismatches (e.g., `CompleteWorkout`, `ProgressionMesocycle` types)
- TypeScript error in `src/routes/analytics/long-term/+page.server.ts` related to `setCorrelationData` type assignment.

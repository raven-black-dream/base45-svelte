## Description
The current implementation recreates metrics from scratch, which is inefficient and can lead to errors
and data inconsistencies. This task focuses on modifying the metrics system to update existing metrics rather than creating new ones each time.

## Objectives
- [x] Modify `src/lib/server/metrics.ts` to check for existing metrics before creating new ones
- [x] Implement UPDATE operations for existing metrics instead of recreating them
- [x] Ensure data consistency during transitions between create and update operations
- [x] Optimize database queries to reduce redundancy

## Technical Notes
- Used a combination of find and update operations in `calculateExerciseMetrics`
- Implemented logic to check for existing metrics by exercise, workout, and metric_name
- Used Promise.all to perform batch updates efficiently
- Optimized the function to separate metrics that need updating from those that need creation

## Validation
- [x] Verified metrics consistency before and after changes
- [x] Performance improved by reducing redundant database operations
- [x] Added unit tests for update operations in `metrics.test.ts`
- [x] Integration tested with the workout completion flow

## Progress
- Started: 2025-03-21
- Updates: Added update functionality to `calculateExerciseMetrics` to match the existing functionality in `calculateMuscleGroupMetrics`
- Completed: 2025-03-21

- `src/lib/server/metrics.test.ts`

## Summary of Changes
Modified the `calculateExerciseMetrics` function to:
1. Query for existing metrics using `findMany`
2. Create a list of metrics to update and metrics to create
3. Use `update` operations for existing metrics
4. Use `createManyAndReturn` only for new metrics
5. Added comprehensive tests to verify the update functionality

This implementation reduces database operations and ensures data consistency by avoiding the creation of duplicate metrics.

## Description
Currently, there's an issue with set ordering in progression functions. Sets need to be consistently ordered when applying progression logic to ensure that the sets are ordered correctly in the workout. 

## Objectives
- [x] Audit all progression functions in `src/lib/server/progression.ts` to ensure they maintain set order
- [x] Implement consistent sorting mechanism for sets
- [x] Ensure set order is preserved during workout completion
- [ ] Add unit tests to verify set order consistency

## Technical Notes
- Sets should be ordered by their position within the previous workout
- Implementation should consider both single-exercise and multi-exercise progressions
- Ensure set order is maintained during deload calculations
- Consider adding a `position` field to sets if not already present

## Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for set order preservation
- [ ] Integration tests with workout completion
- [ ] Manual testing with various progression scenarios

## Progress
- Started: 2023-10-31
- Updates: 
  - 2023-10-31: Implemented set ordering by `set_num` in `modifyRepNumber`, `nonProgression`, `progression`, and `loadAndRepProgression` functions.
  - We now sort workout sets consistently by `set_num` before processing to ensure proper workout progression.
- Completed: TBD

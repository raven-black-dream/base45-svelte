id: TASK-012
status: planned
priority: high
dependencies: []
assigned: TBD

## Description
The application currently doesn't handle the last workouts in a mesocycle optimally. This leads to the
user getting an error when submitting the last workouts of a mesocycle

## Objectives
- [x] Review current handling of final mesocycle workouts
- [x] Implement improved logic for transitioning between mesocycles
- [ ] Add better indicators for when a mesocycle is ending
- [ ] Implement user guidance for starting new mesocycles
- [ ] Ensure proper deload scheduling at mesocycle boundaries

## Technical Notes
- Need to modify progression calculations for final workouts
- Consider adding a "mesocycle completion" logic path
- Add warnings or notifications about approaching mesocycle end
- Ensure data continuity between mesocycles for analytics purposes

## Validation
- [ ] Test mesocycle transitions for various program templates
- [ ] Verify deload timing and implementation
- [ ] Test user experience when completing mesocycles
- [ ] Verify analytics continuity across mesocycles

## Progress
- Started: TBD
- Updates: TBD
- Completed: TBD

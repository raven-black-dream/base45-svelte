## Description
Currently, there's a need to determine the most effective data visualizations for the application to help users understand their training progress and patterns. This task involves evaluating different visualization approaches and implementing selected ones.

## Objectives
- [x] Research effective fitness data visualization methods
- [x] Prototype key visualization types (progress charts, heatmaps, radar charts)
- [ ] Collect feedback on visualization prototypes
- [x] Select final visualization set for implementation (See DECISION-005)
- [ ] Document visualization specifications for development

## Technical Notes
- See `.context/decisions/005_data_visualization_selection_and_placement.md` for the selected visualizations, placement strategy, and data scope.
- Consider Plotly.js capabilities and limitations
- Evaluate mobile responsiveness for all visualizations
- Balance information density with clarity
- Consider different user experience levels
- Ensure accessibility in visualization design

## Visualization Options to Evaluate (Revised based on discussion)
- [x] **Mesocycle Progress Charts:** Separate line charts tracking Total Volume, Subjective Stimulus Score, and Subjective Fatigue Score week-by-week, comparing the last several mesocycles.
- [x] **Rep Range/Load vs. Stimulus Distribution:** Analyze which rep ranges or load percentages yield the highest subjective Stimulus Score per set (e.g., grouped bar chart or scatter plot), filterable by muscle group/exercise.
- [ ] **Subjective Feedback Trends:** Individual line charts tracking the trends of Burn, Pump, Perturbation, Joint Pain, and Recovery ratings over time (weekly averages across mesocycles).
- [x] **Exercise Stimulus-to-Fatigue Ratio (SFR) Ranking:** Rank exercises based on a calculated SFR (Stimulus Score / Fatigue Score), using subjective feedback metrics (e.g., sortable list or scatter plot).
- [ ] **Workout Adherence Visualization:** Compare planned vs. actual sets/reps/load achieved (e.g., gauges or progress bars).
- [ ] **Correlation Plots (Objective vs. Subjective):** Explore relationships between objective variables (Volume, Intensity) and subjective feedback scores (e.g., scatter plots).
- [ ] **Training Frequency/Recency Heatmap:** Simple calendar view showing which days muscle groups were trained.
- [ ] **Personal Record (PR) Timeline/Feed:** Chronological list/feed of key performance records achieved.
- [ ] **SFR Management Features:** (Further discussion needed on implementation)
    - [x] SFR Trend Chart (per exercise)
    - [ ] SFR Threshold Indicators
    - [ ] Low SFR Diagnostics
    - [ ] SFR-Guided Exercise Suggestions

## Validation
- [ ] Test visualizations with sample data sets
- [ ] Collect user feedback on clarity and usefulness
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Confirm technical feasibility

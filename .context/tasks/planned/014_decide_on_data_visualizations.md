## Description
Currently, there's a need to determine the most effective data visualizations for the application to help users understand their training progress and patterns. This task involves evaluating different visualization approaches and implementing selected ones.

## Objectives
- [ ] Research effective fitness data visualization methods
- [ ] Prototype key visualization types (progress charts, heatmaps, radar charts)
- [ ] Collect feedback on visualization prototypes
- [ ] Select final visualization set for implementation
- [ ] Document visualization specifications for development

## Technical Notes
- Consider Plotly.js capabilities and limitations
- Evaluate mobile responsiveness for all visualizations
- Balance information density with clarity
- Consider different user experience levels
- Ensure accessibility in visualization design

## Visualization Options to Evaluate
- [ ] Progress charts (line, bar)
- [ ] Volume heatmaps by muscle group
- [ ] Periodization visualization
- [ ] Performance scoring radar charts
- [ ] Rep/set/weight distribution charts
- [ ] Progressive overload visualization
- [ ] Recovery/readiness tracking

## Validation
- [ ] Test visualizations with sample data sets
- [ ] Collect user feedback on clarity and usefulness
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Confirm technical feasibility

## Progress
- Started: TBD
- Updates: TBD
- Completed: TBD

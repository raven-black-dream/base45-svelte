# Complete Function Optimization

## Context
The `complete` function in `/src/routes/workout/[slug]/+page.server.ts` is currently showing poor performance with a maximum completion time of 7.61 seconds.

## Objective
Reduce the completion time to under 2 seconds by implementing various optimization strategies.

## Tasks

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Combine workout and mesocycle queries into a single query
- [ ] Implement batch updates for progression changes
- [ ] Add appropriate indexes for frequently accessed fields
- [ ] Implement query caching for mesocycle data

### Code Optimization
- [ ] Profile and optimize `shouldDoProgression` function
- [ ] Implement parallel processing where possible
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and logging
- [ ] Optimize muscle group calculations

### Success Metrics
- Primary: Reduce maximum completion time from 7.61s to under 2s
- Secondary: Reduce average completion time by 75%
- Monitor: CPU usage and memory consumption

## Dependencies
- Requires coordination with database optimization tasks
- May need updates to Prisma schema
- Potential updates to progression logic

## Notes
- Consider implementing progress feedback for long-running operations -> This is done
- Maintain data consistency during optimization
- Document any changes to progression logic

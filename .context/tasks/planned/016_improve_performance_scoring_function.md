# Improve Performance Scoring Function

---
id: TASK-016
status: planned
priority: high

## Description
The current performance scoring function requires deeper analysis and potential improvements to better reflect actual training performance. This task involves reviewing the current approach and implementing evidence-based improvements.

## Objectives
- [ ] Analyze existing performance scoring algorithm
- [ ] Research evidence-based approaches to performance measurement
- [ ] Identify weaknesses in current implementation
- [ ] Develop improved scoring methodology
- [ ] Implement and test new scoring function
- [ ] Document scoring methodology for transparency

## Technical Notes
- Current implementation may not properly account for all relevant factors
- Consider variables such as:
  - Volume vs intensity tradeoffs
  - Rep ranges and proximity to failure
  - Exercise category (compound vs isolation)
  - Performance relative to previous maximums
  - Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) when available
- Score should remain intuitive and useful to users
- Consider backwards compatibility with existing scores

## Validation
- [ ] Test against historical workout data
- [ ] Verify alignment with research-backed performance metrics
- [ ] Check correlation with user-reported satisfaction
- [ ] Ensure consistency across different workout types

## Progress
- Started: TBD
- Updates: TBD
- Completed: TBD

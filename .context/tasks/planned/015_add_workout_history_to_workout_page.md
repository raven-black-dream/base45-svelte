## Description
Users currently lack easy access to their workout history while performing workouts. This task involves adding a workout history component to the workout page, allowing users to see their previous performance for the exercises they're currently performing. Specifically this targets the "current week" of the mesocycle.

## Objectives
- [ ] Design UI for displaying relevant workout history
- [ ] Implement workout history component for the workout page
- [ ] Add filtering options for history view
- [ ] Optimize database queries to fetch relevant history
- [ ] Ensure performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Add mobile-responsive design for the history component

## Technical Notes
- Focus on showing relevant previous performances (same exercise, similar rep ranges)
- Consider collapsible/expandable design to save space
- Implement lazy loading for history data
- Consider caching previous workout data during session
- Ensure history component doesn't detract from workout entry UX

## Validation
- [ ] Test performance impact on workout page load time
- [ ] Verify usefulness and relevance of displayed history
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] User testing for workflow integration

## Progress
- Started: TBD
- Updates: TBD

# Update Existing Metrics

---
id: TASK-011
status: planned
priority: high
dependencies: [008]
assigned: TBD

## Description
The current implementation recreates metrics from scratch, which is inefficient and can lead to errors
and data inconsistencies. This task focuses on modifying the metrics system to update existing metrics rather than creating new ones each time.

## Objectives
- [ ] Modify `src/lib/server/metrics.ts` to check for existing metrics before creating new ones
- [ ] Implement UPDATE operations for existing metrics instead of recreating them
- [ ] Ensure data consistency during transitions between create and update operations
- [ ] Optimize database queries to reduce redundancy

## Technical Notes
- Use upsert operations where possible
- Ensure atomic updates to prevent race conditions
- Consider implementing changesets for metric updates
- Review current metrics calculation for potential optimization

## Validation
- [ ] Verify metrics consistency before and after changes
- [ ] Performance testing to ensure improved efficiency
- [ ] Unit tests for update operations
- [ ] Integration testing with workout completion flow

## Progress
- Started: TBD
- Updates: TBD
- Completed: TBD

# SFR Management Features Implementation

## Overview
Design and implement advanced SFR (Stimulus-to-Fatigue Ratio) management features to help users optimize their training based on SFR metrics.

## Objectives
- [ ] Design and implement SFR threshold indicators
- [ ] Create a low SFR diagnostics system
- [ ] Develop SFR-guided exercise suggestions
- [ ] Enhance existing SFR trend visualization

## Technical Notes
- Need to determine appropriate SFR thresholds based on user data and research
- Consider machine learning possibilities for exercise suggestions
- Must integrate with existing analytics system
- Consider real-time SFR calculations during workouts

## Implementation Details
### SFR Threshold Indicators
- Define healthy SFR ranges for different muscle groups
- Create visual indicators for when SFR falls outside optimal range
- Consider user customization of thresholds

### Low SFR Diagnostics
- Analyze patterns in workouts with low SFR
- Identify potential contributing factors:
  - Volume too high
  - Insufficient recovery
  - Poor exercise selection
  - Inappropriate loading

### SFR-Guided Exercise Suggestions
- Develop algorithm for suggesting exercises based on:
  - Historical SFR data
  - User preferences
  - Training goals
  - Current fatigue levels

## Discussion Points
- What should be the default SFR thresholds?
- How to handle exercise suggestions for new users with limited data?
- Should we implement different thresholds for different training phases?
- How to balance automated suggestions with user autonomy?

## Dependencies
- Existing SFR calculation system
- Analytics infrastructure
- User feedback data

## Validation
- [ ] Verify threshold calculations
- [ ] Test diagnostic accuracy
- [ ] Validate exercise suggestions
- [ ] User testing of interface

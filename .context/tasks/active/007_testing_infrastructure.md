## Objective
Establish a comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Tasks

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Set up Playwright test environment
- [ ] Create test scenarios for critical user flows
- [ ] Implement CI pipeline for E2E tests
- [ ] Add visual regression testing

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Set up Vitest configuration
- [ ] Create test templates and utilities
- [ ] Add tests for core business logic
- [ ] Implement coverage reporting

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Set up performance benchmarking
- [ ] Create baseline performance metrics
- [ ] Implement automated performance testing
- [ ] Add performance regression detection

## Success Metrics
- 80% test coverage for core functionality
- All critical user flows covered by E2E tests
- <5 minute test suite execution time
- Zero known bugs in production

## Notes
- Focus on maintainable tests
- Document testing practices
- Set up monitoring for test failures
- Create debugging guides

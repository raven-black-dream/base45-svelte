## Objective
Improve application performance through strategic optimizations in database queries, client-side data management, and bundle size reduction.

## Tasks

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Implement query caching layer
- [ ] Optimize common query patterns
- [ ] Add database indexes for frequent queries
- [X] Implement connection pooling

### Client-side Performance
- [ ] Implement client-side caching strategy
- [ ] Optimize state management
- [ ] Add lazy loading for routes
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for long lists

### Bundle Size Reduction
- [ ] Analyze bundle size with source-map-explorer
- [X] Implement code splitting
- [X] Optimize dependency imports
- [ ] Set up automatic bundle analysis in CI

## Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in average query time
- <3s initial page load time
- <1s subsequent page loads
- <200kb initial bundle size

## Notes
- Focus on high-impact areas first
- Document performance improvements
- Add monitoring for key metrics

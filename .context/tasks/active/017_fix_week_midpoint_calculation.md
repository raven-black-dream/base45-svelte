## Description
The current week midpoint calculation does not accurately determine the midpoint of a week, which impacts
the progression mechanism for deload weeks.

## Objectives
- [ ] Identify the current implementation of week midpoint calculation
- [ ] Determine the correct approach for calculating week boundaries
- [ ] Fix implementation to handle edge cases (month transitions, leap years, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure consistency with user expectations about week definitions
- [ ] Update any dependent functionality that relies on week calculations

## Technical Notes
- Week definition may need to be configurable (Monday-Sunday, Sunday-Saturday, etc.)
- Consider user timezone when calculating week boundaries
- Ensure calculations work correctly for programs that span multiple weeks
- Review any date/time libraries being used and ensure proper implementation
- Consider adding tests specifically for date/time calculations

## Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for week boundary calculations
- [ ] Test edge cases (month/year transitions)
- [ ] Verify correct behavior with different user timezones
- [ ] Integration testing with scheduling and progression features

## Progress
- Started: TBD
- Updates: TBD
- Completed: TBD
